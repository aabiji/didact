# Didact

A simple notes app

Some ideas:
- whispercpp integration to get rela time speech to text (voice input)
  - Real time translation to english or the target language
- Spawn a desktop and android daemon to be able to start note taking using a code word (kind of like siri)
  (open a temporary note -> make it easy to copy/paste so it can be used for dictation as well)
- Save audio recordings/notes to disk
- Same ethos as obsidian where you're in charge of your files
- Minimailist ui (black background, clean white text in a large font)
