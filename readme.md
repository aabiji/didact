- Option to save the recording
  - Save the text file and the audio file to a default user folder
- Make the text input have a border and remove its background
- Make the buttons have icons instead of text
- Add a back buttonA
- Sketch some UI ideas for the note editor
- Make the text font bigger

A simple notes app

- Same ethos as obsidian where you're in charge of your files
- Minimailist ui (black background, clean white text in a large font)
- Big idea: Samsung Notes clone that's open source, cross platform and fast, with voice dicdation
