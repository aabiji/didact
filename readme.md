Thoughts:
- Make the text read only during playback (until the stop button is pressed)
- Concept of UI pages?
- We have to implement out own text input widget if we want markdown syntax highlighting
- Button to copy the transcription or save the transcription
- Start implementing a custon text editing widget

A simple notes app

- Same ethos as obsidian where you're in charge of your files
- Minimailist ui (black background, clean white text in a large font)
- Big idea: Samsung Notes clone that's open source, cross platform and fast, with voice dicdation
